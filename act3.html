          One of the major reasons business, home and other users purchase computers is for internet access. The internet is a widely used research tool, providing <br> society with access to global information and instant communications. Further, access to the internet can occur anytime from a computer anywhere: at home, <br> at work, at school, in a  restaurant, on an airplane, and at a park. <br> <br>
          The internet, also called the Net, is a worldwide collection of networks that links to millions of businesses, government agencies, educational institutions, <br> and individuals. Each of the networks on the internet provides resources that add to the abundance of goods, services, and information accessible via the internet. <br><br>
          Today, more than one billion home and business users around the world access a variety of services on the internet. The world wide web, or simply the Web, and <br> e-mail are two of the more widely used internet services. Other services include chatrooms, instant messaging, and VoIP (Voiceover Internet Protocol).<br><br>

          <b>HTML</b> stands for <b><i>Hyper Text Markup Language.</b></i> It is used to design web pages using markup language. HTML is the combination of Hypertext and markup<br>language. Hypertext defines the link between the webpages. Markup language is used to define the text document within tag which defines the structure of web pages. This language<br> is used to annotate(make notes for the computer) text so that a machine can understand it and manipulate text accordingly. Most of markup (eg. HTML) languages are human readable.<br> Language uses tags to define what manipulation has to be done on on the text.<br><br>
             HTML is a markup language which is used by the browser to manipulate text, images and other content to display it in required format. HTML was created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991.<br> The first ever version of HTML was HTML 1.0 but the first standard version was HTML 2.0 which was published in 1999.

<u>HTML - TEXT
</p></u></b></font>
<pre align="center"><font face = "Times New Roman">
                Text is the backbone of any webpage. It plays a double role; it provides content for web surfers to enjoy as they skim through articles and  articles of information, but it also gives<br> search engines and spider keywords and meta data. It is because of text on web pages that we have a network of seemingly endless information available at our fingers.
